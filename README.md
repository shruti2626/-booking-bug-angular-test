# -booking-bug-angular-test
## Getting Started

To get you started you can simply clone the `booking-bug-angular-test` repository and install the dependencies:

### Prerequisites

You need git to clone the `booking-bug-angular-test` repository. You can get git from [here][git].

 You must have Node.js and its package manager (npm) installed.

### Clone `booking-bug-angular-test`

Clone the `booking-bug-angular-test` repository using git:

```
git clone https://github.com/shruti2626/-booking-bug-angular-test.git
cd booking-bug-angular-test


### Install Dependencies

We have two kinds of dependencies in this project: tools and AngularJS framework code. The tools
help us manage and test the application.

* We get the tools we depend upon and the AngularJS code via `npm`, the [Node package manager][npm].
*
We have preconfigured `npm` to automatically copy the downloaded AngularJS files to `app/lib` so we
can simply do:

```
npm install
```

Behind the scenes this will also call `npm run copy-libs`, which copies the AngularJS files and
other front end dependencies. After that, you should find out that you have two new directories in
your project.

* `node_modules` - contains the npm packages for the tools we need
* `app/lib` - contains the AngularJS framework files and other front end dependencies

*Note copying the AngularJS files from `node_modules` to `app/lib` makes it easier to serve the
files by a web server.*

### Run the Application

We have preconfigured the project with a simple development web server. The simplest way to start
this server is:

```
npm start
```

Now browse to the app at [`localhost:8000/index.html`][local-app-url].


## Directory Layout

```
app/                  --> all of the source files for the application
  app.css               --> default stylesheet
      app.js                --> main application module
	  template              ---> view file 
  index.html            --> app layout file (the main html template file of the app)
  e2e-tests/            --> end-to-end tests
  protractor-conf.js    --> Protractor config file
  scenarios.js          --> end-to-end scenarios to be run by Protractor
karma.conf.js         --> config file for running unit tests with Karma
package.json          --> Node.js specific metadata, including development tools dependencies
package-lock.json     --> Npm specific metadata, including versions of installed development tools dependencies
```





## Updating AngularJS and other dependencies

Since the AngularJS framework library code and tools are acquired through package managers (e.g.
npm) you can use these tools to easily update the dependencies. Simply run the preconfigured script:

```
npm run update-deps
```

This will call `npm update` and `npm run copy-libs`, which in turn will find and install the latest
versions that match the version ranges specified in the `package.json` file.

If you want to update a dependency to a version newer than what the specificed range would permit,
you can change the version range in `package.json` and then run `npm run update-deps` as usual.




### Running the App in Production

This really depends on how complex your app is and the overall infrastructure of your system, but
the general rule is that all you need in production are the files under the `app/` directory.
Everything else should be omitted.

AngularJS apps are really just a bunch of static HTML, CSS and JavaScript files that need to be
hosted somewhere they can be accessed by browsers.

If your AngularJS app is talking to the backend server via XHR or other means, you need to figure
out what is the best way to host the static files to comply with the same origin policy if
applicable. Usually this is done by hosting the files by the backend server or through
reverse-proxying the backend server(s) and web server(s).
